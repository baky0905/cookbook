## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1
Add beef to a bowl with baking soda and mix thoroughly to incorporate.

Preheat a large nonstick pan over medium high. Add a squeeze (Tbsp or so) of olive oil followed by diced onions, poblanos, and a pinch of salt. Saute for 3-4 mins, stirring often. When veg has softened a bit and has started to brown, add in beef/baking soda mix, using a meat musher or wooden spoon to break up meat into small pieces. When beef is broken down well and is beginning to brown, add salt (5g), onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, paprika, and chile flake. Stir to combine and cook for about 30 seconds.

Add flour and stir to combine and cook for a few seconds. Add tomato products, mustard, brown sugar, worchestershire, vinegar, bouillon, and stock. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer then reduce heat to medium low to reduce for about 10-12 minutes, continuing to stir and break up meat as sauce reduces. Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed.

Serve on toasted brioche bun.
