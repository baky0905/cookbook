## :pencil: Instructions

This is an alternative to the hollandaise based mustard sauce you may know. This home cooking version is based on a b√©chamel and is much easier to do. It goes great with chicken, fish or toasted sandwiches.

### Step 1
Melt the butter in a pan, and, once melted, reduce the heat and stir the flour into the butter to make a paste and cook for 2 minutes
Turn off the heat and allow to completely cool (putting it in the fridge is a good idea).

### Step 2
Halve the shallot and stand a clove into each half.
Put the milk into a pan and add the shallot halves, the thyme, the bay leaf and salt and pepper On a medium heat, bring the milk to a simmer.
Once simmering, remove from the heat and pass half of the milk through a sieve into the other pan containing the paste.

### Step 3
Off the heat, whisk all together until all is incorporated then whisk in the remaining milk.
Turn the heat to medium low and start to thicken the roux, whisking all the time.
After it comes to a light boil, continue whisking for another minute or two then reduce the heat to very low and incorporate the cream.
Add the vinegar and the mustard and stir it in (from this point onward the sauce should never be boiled).  If necessary adjust the consistency by stirring in more cream, and if desired, add some extra in Dijon mustard for a more yellowish color and more a more prononce mustard taste.
