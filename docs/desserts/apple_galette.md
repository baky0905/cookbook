## :pencil: Instructions

### Crust

#### Step 1
Add flour, sugar, and salt to food processor and process until combined. Add in cold cubed butter. Pulse until butter is incorporated and flour mix has become pebbly. Stream in ice cold water while pulsing (no more than 12-15 pulses to not overwork the dough).

#### Step 2
Dump dough out onto plastic wrap, squeeze into a mass, wrap and flatten into a big puck. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Allow to sit at room temperature for around 15 minutes before rolling out.

#### Step 3
Before baking, preheat oven to 190C.

### Apple Filling

#### Step 1
Gengly combine apples with the rest of the ingredients to coat. Allow apple mixture to sit while you roll out the dough.

### Rolling out the dough and baking the gallete

#### Step 1
Flour dough and work surface then roll out, using downward pressure, into a flat 30cm wide circle. Transfer onto a piece of parchment then continue to roll out into a 33-35c wide circle.

#### Step 2
Lay apples onto galette dough and pleat crust as shown @6:45 (or dump them all in the center if you want to be less fussy).

#### Step 4
Brush visible crust with egg wash then sprinkle egg washed crust with sugar in the raw.

#### Step 5
Drizzle in a few spoons of the cinnamon corn starch slurry that the apples were sitting in. Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky salt and place 3-4 slices of butter on the apples.  Transfer galette and parchment onto baking sheet and bake at 190C for 40-50min, rotating pan halfway through.
