## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1
1) Beat butter together with vanilla powder until creamy, then add sour cream, spoon by spoon.

### Step 2
2) Mix one part of flour with baking powder and add to the mixture of sour cream and butter. Gradually mix in the remaining flour.

### Step 3
3) When the mass is compact and does not stick to the pan, start making immediately.

### Step 4
4) Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 3 mm and to the size of a rectangle or square.

### Step 5
5) Cut it so that the edges are straight and into 6 cm wide strips.

### Step 6
6) Put the filling in a piping bag, cut a small opening, then apply to the middle of each strip (as in the video).

### Step 7
7) Fold each side to the left and right towards the middle and pinch with your fingers. Cut off the excess dough on the upper side with scissors and press the strudel a little to make it flat. Place it on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Do the same with the remaining strips. Gather the remaining dough into a ball, roll it out, cut it into strips, etc.

### Step 8
8) Take a pastry knife and cut them into pieces approximately 5-6 cm wide.

### Step 9
9) Bake in a heated oven at 180C degrees for about 15-18 minutes. They should remain white.

### Step 10
10) Let them cool completely, then sprinkle them with powdered sugar. Keep them in a dry and cool place in a metal box, which you have lined with kitchen paper. That way they will stay fresh for several weeks.
