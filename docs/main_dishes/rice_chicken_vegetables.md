## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1
First, prepare the marinade for the chicken drumsticks. Put salt, pepper, vegetables, paprika and oil in a bowl, and if desired, other spices you like. Mix well and rub the marinade well into each drumstick or coat with a cooking brush.

### Step 2
Place the meat in a container, cover with a lid or aluminum foil and leave in the fridge for at least half an hour (if you are in a hurry, you can use the meat immediately).

### Step 3
Heat the oven to 200 C degrees (upper and lower heaters). Wash the rice, drain and place in a medium-sized ovenproof dish or pan (approximately 33x23cm). If you want a larger portion, simply take a double measure (eg for a large oven tray).

### Step 4
Peel the white and red onions and potatoes. Wash the potatoes and cut them into cubes, and cut the onions into small cubes. Chop the white onion as small as possible and add it together with the potatoes, red onion and frozen vegetables to the pan/refractory dish together with the rice.

### Step 5
Add the appropriate amount of water and season everything a little more and mix. Put the pan in the oven and bake the rice with vegetables for about 20 minutes until the water is reduced by half.

### Step 6
While the rice is baking, heat the oil in a large pan, take the chicken out of the fridge and fry it on medium heat for 5-7 minutes on each side to catch the color. It doesn't have to be completely cooked. When the chicken is ready and the rice has almost absorbed the water, arrange the chicken on top of the rice.

### Step 7
Then you bake everything together for another 15-20 minutes until all the water evaporates. Check once again that the potatoes are soft enough and the chicken is cooked.

### Step 8 (Optional)
If you wish, you can pour sweet cream over everything (if you want the rice to be especially creamy) and bake for another 5 minutes. Serve with a good green salad and a piece of homemade white bread.
