## :pencil: Instructions

### Bread bowl

#### Step 1

Add ingredients including all of the poolish to a bowl and stir to combine until a clump has formed. Continue to mix with a very wet hand until fully combined and no longer clumpy. To us a stand mixer instead, just mix to combine. 

#### Step 2
Cover and allow to rise for 30min. Conduct strength building folds (stretch and folds and slap and folds) as shown @1:45. Cover and ferment for another 30min. Repeat the stretch and folds/slap and folds. Cover and ferment for 1 hour. 

#### Step 3
Flip floured dough onto floured work surface then divide dough into 4 even (250ish grams) pieces. To shape degas, then follow shaping instructions as shown @2:58. Place shaped balls onto parchment and proof covered at room temp on a non-stone or steel surface for 60-90min. 

#### Step 4
Split parchment onto 4 quadrants so that each dough ball is on itâ€™s own small piece of parchment. Mist with water then score the top of each dough ball. 

#### Step 5
Transfer dough balls onto preheated pizza stone, spritz with water again, cover, and bake at 240C for 15min. 

After 15min CAREFULLY remove lid (escaping steam will be v hot). Rotate loaves and spread apart. Continue baking for 20min. 

### Soup

#### Step 1
Preheat large pot over med-high heat. Add oil. Add vegetables and a pinch of salt. Stir. Sweat veg for 6-8 mins. Once beginning to soften, add flour. Stir to coat veg and cook for a couple of minutes, just to cook off the raw edge, before adding in chicken stock and cream. Stir, reduce heat to med-low and continue to cook for 10min. 

#### Step 2
When veggies are tender, but not mushy, reduce heat to low. Scoop about 3-4c of soup into a tall sided sauce pot and blend with immersion blender (or blend with standard blender). Add blended soup back into the original soup pot and stir. Stir in cheese. Taste for seasoning. I typically add an additional pinch of salt or two. 

Garnish with black pepper and an additional pinch of shredded cheese!
