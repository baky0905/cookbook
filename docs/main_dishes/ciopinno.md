## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1
Into a medium sauce pot, add the shells from 1lb shrimp, stock, and clam juice. Bring to a simmer and continue simmer over medium low for about 15min. 

### Step 2
Heat a large heavy bottomed pot over medium. Add very generous squeeze of olive oil (it should almost coat the bottom fo your pot. To that, add onion, fennel, and garlic and a large pinch of salt. Stir and sweat over medium for 4-5min. 

### Step 3
Add pinch of chile flake to veg. Allow chile flake to cook and infuse the oil for about a minute, then add in wine. Bring wine and veg to a simmer and continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes or until wine is mostly evaporated. 

Add in all of the strained liquid from your shrimp-clam stock (discard shrimp shells). You should be adding about 1200g/mL here. If you don’t have enough, add additional chicken stock or water. Stir in pureed tomatoes. Increase heat to medium high, bring to a boil. Continue to simmer and reduce for approx 15min by about 15-20%. 

Taste base for seasoning. Add salt and pinch of sugar if needed to balance acidity. 

### Step 4
Reduce heat to low then drop in cod, shrimp, and squid. Gently move with a spoon to ensure everything is spread evenly and submerged before adding in mussels and snuggling them into the base to submerge. Bring to a simmer, cover, and allow to poach for 3-4 mins. 

### Step 5
Very gently stir the seafood. Continue to cook if mussels aren’t yet fully open. When mussels are fully opened and the rest of the fish is opaque, it’s done! Discard any mussels that didn’t open during cooking. 

Ladle into a bowl, garnish with black pepper, olive oil, and minced parsley, and enjoy with crusty bread.
