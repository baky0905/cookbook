## :salt: Ingredients
- 1.3 kg chicken with skin and bones
- 500 ml of chicken stock
- 200 g of sour cream
- 60 ml of cooking cream
- 3-4 tablespoons of Hungarian paprika powder
- 3 tablespoons of flour
- 2 tablespoons of lard
- 2 onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 tomatoes
- salt and pepper as desired

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1
Melt the lard in a large pot and fry the chicken on all sides. Put the chicken aside.

### Step 2
Saute the chopped onion in the same fat. Saute it until it gets a golden-brown color.
Add the chopped garlic and saute everything together for another 30 seconds.
Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer for another two to three minutes.
Season with Hungarian paprika powder, salt and steam. Mix it up.

### Step 3
Return the chicken to the pot and cover with chicken stock. Cook at a low temperature for about 40 minutes until the meat is thermally processed to the end and the flavors combine.
Remove the chicken from the pot again and set aside.
In a separate bowl, mix sour cream, cooking cream and flour. Mix the obtained paste into the pot. Stir the mixture for a few minutes to avoid the formation of possible lumps.

### Step 4
When the stew thickens, add the chicken again and mix everything well.
