## :pencil: Instructions

### Pita
#### Step 1
Add ingredients to stand mixer with dough hook attachment. Mix on low for 2 mins or until dough comes together. Increase speed to high and continue mixing for about 4 minutes, careful not to overdevelop the dough. When the dough looks more smooth and passes the tug test (no tearing when you tug a piece) itâ€™s ready. 

Separate dough into 6 even (130ish gram) pieces, shaping and rounding each into a ball as shown in video @1:02. Transfer all shaped dough balls to a lightly oiled sheet tray and wrap tightly. Refrigerate to cold ferment for 4 to 24 hours. 

### Step 2
To roll out pitas, lightly flour work surface and dough ball then press with your hand to spread into a 10cm circle. Use a rolling pin roll out until dough is about 3mm thick and about 23cm in diameter, making sure to keep work surface and dough well dusted while rolling. 

### Step 2
Brush off excess flour, then load dough onto a pizza peel then onto a 220C preheated pizza steel/stone to bake for 3-4 minutes, flipping over halfway through. Roll out the next pita while pita 1 is baking. Place in a towel lined bowl or basket and cover with a towel to keep baked pitas warm while you finish the rest.  

### Hummus

Add soaked beans and water into a along with baking soda. Cook for 15 minutes. Beans should be soft but not disintegrated. Drain off as much cooking liquid as possible then transfer beans to a food processor along with tahini, salt, lemon juice, and citric acid. Process for 3 minutes then stream in olive oil while still spinning. Then add in ice cubes one at a time until hummus reaches desired texture/consistency. 

Taste for seasoning and add extra  lemon juice, salt, and/or olive oil if needed. Spin for a few seconds to combine. 

Serve with olive oil, a sprinkle of sumac, and flaky salt. 

## Additional Notes
I halfed the quantities in the video, and did not use dry beans but rather ready made.
