Flavour gets better with time. Dough will stay bubbly for a day or two, then will deflate \u2013 that\u2019s fine. Shape into round and place on paper per recipe, then leave for 45 \u2013 60 minutes to take the chill out of it, then bake per recipe. Cold dough won\u2019t rise as well. Bread in photos &amp; video is 2 hr rise, immediate bake. Cooked bread \u2013 great fresh for 2 days, then after that, better warmed or toasted.  Keep in an airtight container or ziplock bag. This stays more fresh than usual homemade bread, especially if you use bread flour. Freeze cooked bread for up to 3 months.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Flour \u2013 bread flour will give a more the crumb a more chewy, fluffy texture like bakery Artisan bread because it has higher protein, and bread stays fresher for longer. Plain / all purpose flour still works 100% perfectly, texture is just not quite the same. Wholemeal/wholewheat flour \u2013 start with 30g/ \u00bc cup less flour and just add more as needed to get the consistency shown in the video (because wholemeal flour is a bit more absorbent than white, I find).</p> </li> <li> <p>Yeast \u2013 use yeast labelled \u201cinstant\u201d or \u201crapid rise\u201d. If you can only find normal yeast (can be labelled \u201cactive dry yeast\u201d) then dissolve yeast in water first (no need to let it foam), then immediately add flour and salt and mix. Proceed with recipe as written.</p> </li> <li> <p>Salt \u2013 reduce to 1 \u00bc tsp if using table salt (finer grains = less volume for same amount of salt) otherwise it will be too salty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Water temperature \u2013 if it\u2019s so scorching hot you wouldn\u2019t bathe in it, it will kill the yeast. If it\u2019s a lovely temp you could sit in for hours in a bubble bath, it\u2019s the perfect temp.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dough consistency can be affected by factors like different brands of flour, humidity in air. If dough is too dry, add touch of water. Too wet, add a touch of flour. Compare to video at 17 seconds and photos above.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dough rising \u2013 time will vary depending on room temperature, humidity, flour you use etc. It\u2019s fine if it rises faster or slower \u2013 you just need to achieve the dough rise as specified (double volume, bubbly surface, wobbly consistency, per video at 24 seconds). I told you \u2013 this recipe is forgiving! If it\u2019s coldish in your kitchen (22\u00b0C/70\u00b0F or less) OR it\u2019s just not rising (check at 1 hour), then tuck the bowl somewhere warmer. Yeast loves warmth! Simple method I use: in sink with warm (not hot) water, with ramekin to elevate bowl above water level. Or run dryer for a few minutes then place bowl in there. Do not put bowl in direct sunlight indoors \u2013 too hot. But in shade near sunlight is good! If dough rises faster than 2 hours (eg super hot day), then put bowl in fridge to stop the rise while you preheat the oven. On super hot summer days, it can rise in 45 minutes!</p> </li> <li> <p>Oven preheating \u2013 If baking immediately, start preheating oven when you can see dough is rising (at 1.5 hours) or if you refrigerated, while dough is resting to take chill out of it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>It\u2019s also fine to shape the dough into a round, place it on parchment paper and leave for 30 minutes while oven preheats (I told you this is a flexible recipe!!) 8. Dutch oven (cast iron pot) creates a steamer effect, a home version of professional steamer ovens used by bakeries to make bread.  Pot size does not matter as long as it\u2019s about 26cm/10\u2033 or larger. Pot does not shape the bread, it\u2019s to act as a steamer. Just need one large enough to give bread steaming space. No dutch oven method \u2013 use 20cm/8\u201d square metal pan (or similar but NOT glass, may shatter). Place in oven on middle shelf where bread will bake (or shelf under if tray won\u2019t fit on same shelf), preheat oven. Boil kettle. Place paper with shaped dough on a baking tray. When you put the bread in, work fast as follows \u2013 place bread in oven, fill pan with boiling water, shut oven door = makeshift dutch oven steamer effect! Bake for full 40 minutes until it\u2019s a deep golden brown. Heavy roasting pan with high lid should also work \u2013 preheat per recipe. Bread is about 8-10cm/3.2-4\u2033 tall. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Fridge = slows down yeast rising = time to let enzymes in the yeast to do their work, transforming starch into sugar which creates a more flavourful bread. See notes in post for more info.</p> </li> <li> <p>Different measures in different countries \u2013 cup sizes differ slightly between countries. The difference is not enough to affect the outcome of most recipes, but for baking recipes, it does matter. For this bread, as long as you use EITHER cups OR weights &amp; mls for the flour and water, this recipe will work fine (I tested with US and Aus cups which have the greatest variance in size).</p> </li> <li> <p>Source: Adapted from this recipe from New York Times (halved the recipe to make one batch, and added useful tips and tricks after much trial and error over the years).</p> </li> <li> <p>Nutrition per slice</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["dough"]},{"location":"snacks/easy_bread/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>Original Recipe Source</p>","tags":["dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/","title":"Focaccia Bread (No-Knead)","text":"","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#focaccia-bread-no-knead","title":"Focaccia Bread (No-Knead)","text":"","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#video-tutorial","title":"Video Tutorial","text":"","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#timing-and-quantity","title":"Timing and Quantity","text":"Serves  Total Time x portions 35 minutes (cook time)","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#ingredients","title":"Ingredients","text":"<ul> <li> 600g All-Purpose Flour</li> <li> 450g Warm Water</li> <li> 6g Sea Salt</li> <li> 20g Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li> <li> 1g Active Dry Yeast </li> </ul>","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#instructions","title":"Instructions","text":"","tags":["bread","dough"]},{"location":"snacks/foccacia/#step-1","title":"Step 1","text":"<p>Make the Dough &amp; Bulk Fermentation To start, combine the all-purpose flour and yeast in a large bowl.
